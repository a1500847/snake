# The Snake Game
This is a game I made to learn [p5.js](https://p5js.org/).

It's based on code by Daniel Shiffman, which you can find here:
https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code/tree/master/CodingChallenges/CC_03_Snake_game_p5.js

You can play the game here: https://mlaihonen.github.io/snake-game/
